## 🛠️ Methodology

### Data Collection
- Data was collected directly from the shop owner over three months (October–December 2022).
- Collected data included:
  - **Sales data**: Daily transactions, volume, and revenue.
  - **Inventory data**: Opening and closing stock, purchases, and unsold stock.
  - **Product details**: Categories, SKUs, pricing, and cost.
- Data was initially unstructured (handwritten notes, bills) and digitized into Excel for analysis.

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate and incomplete entries.
- Added derived columns like revenue, cost, and profit for detailed analysis.
- Created structured sheets for sales, inventory, and SKU-level data.

### Data Analysis
- **Tools Used**: MS Excel for pivot tables, charts, and trend analysis.
- **Key Analysis Areas**:
  - Monthly, weekly, and daily sales and revenue trends.
  - Revenue contribution and profit margins by product.
  - Inventory efficiency (average days of inventory).
  - Scatter plots to evaluate product pricing vs. sales performance.

## 📊 Key Insights

### Sales Trends
- Maximum sales during festive months (October and December) due to Dussehra, Diwali, and Christmas.
- Significant drop in sales during mid-week days (Tuesday–Thursday) and mid-month periods.

### Inventory Analysis
- Inefficient inventory management for low-performing items (e.g., accessories).
- High-performing items (e.g., jeans and shoes) require better stock planning to avoid stockouts.

### Revenue and Profit Analysis
- Two products (B01 - Jeans, F01 - Shoes) contributed 65% of total profit (combined Rs. 40,000).
- Low revenue and sales for certain items that occupy shelf space, especially accessories.
